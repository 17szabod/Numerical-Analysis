%Hermite simply looks so much better! Notice in the first image (n=5) how the red function seems to curve rather sharply. This is because it is local even more so that cubic splines, so it can change it's shape and direction suddeny
%Another thing to note is how horrendous these errors are! Hermite error is always slightly lower, but further application with much higher value of n reveals that his function is converging very slowly (mostly because I bounded it at 10, in hindsight)
%Also note that the ratio is almost exactly the same, near (1/5), as should be with the error formulae

%The second run is very interesting... Hermite is thrown off by the value at 20 while cubic stays on course
%This is the first run where cubic was better
%This could be attributed to locallity! The fact that the function acts strangely (unlike a cubic polynomial) on that interval in particular is highlighted by Hermite interpolation while Cubic Splines show it less by being less local and taking into consideration the next two points

%Very strange! The Cubic Hermite seems to get the derivative wrong, despite the fact that dk is completely correct!
%I will take credit for it however because I did predict this would not converge
%Also notice that the cubic spline interpolant is failing as well, just less visibly and less so
